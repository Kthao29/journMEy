## Overview

Similar to how individuals rely on reviews to make informed decisions about dining, we envisioned an app that could help travelers find reviews about cities, helping them decide on their next journey destination. Through the app, users can access city reviews from around the world, favorite cities they wish to visit, revisit their own previous reviews, and contribute new reviews for the benefit of others.

## Target Audience

1. Travel Enthusiasts: Those who love exploring new places.
2. Backpackers: Budget travelers seeking adventurous experiences.
3. Solo Travelers: Individuals who enjoy independent travel.
4. Family Travelers: Families looking for kid-friendly destinations.
